A branch and bound strategy to generate all possible naps given some [constraits](src/components/Configuration.tsx) and [filters](src/components/Filters.tsx).

The only purpose of this project is to learn a bit of Typescript, React, GitHub Pages, Prompt Engineering, and so on. 

With _a bit_ of help from ChatGPT, the Schedule Service was translated from .NET to Typescript. 
In fact nearly all the code here is scaffolded by ChatGPT.
What a glorious bitch has been invented.
